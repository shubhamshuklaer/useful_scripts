  * Some useful scripts that I use
  * No guarantee of working
  * Some of them uses aliases present in my bash repository

# Script's description

  * **youtube_downloader.bash** - wrapper around youtube-dl and [pycurl-downloader](https://github.com/rajatkhanduja/PyCurl-Downloader) for fast downloading of youtube videos from terminal. Currently supports vedio format specification and downloading part of a youtube video. Takes url from clipboard.
  * **turnitin_submission_script.bash** - This script combines all files in a given folder with given extension into one combined_file and then can also recreate the same dir structure from the same combined_file useful for submitting projects on turnitin which only accepts a single file.
  * **memory_low_notify.sh** - [link to original source](http://askubuntu.com/questions/234292/warning-when-available-ram-approaches-zero). Notifies when memory is low using notify-osd. I have made some minor modification to it.
  * **conv_songs_watch.sh** - I download a lot of video songs from youtube. But most of the times I only listen the songs and not watch the videos. This scripts watches a folder for any new videos and convert them to mp3.
  * **check_bat0_status.bash** - I use it with xmobarr to display consise battery status.
